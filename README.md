this code is absolute dog shit, mixture of the remains of my brain and AI.
im not going to do anything with it or update it, this was just a hopeless try to use local mysql with c++.
the code was written on linux installing only soci and mysql. To make it work on windows you have to install soci, mysql and openssl, in some cases mingw too.
i ain't explaining how to make it work on windows cuz in the end it didn't work for me either, so good luck!
